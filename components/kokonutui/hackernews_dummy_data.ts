Based on our research, we found that many businesses are either not using password managers at all and&#x2F;or employees are using sticky notes or other similarly unsafe methods to remember their passwords. We also found that of the businesses that are currently using password managers, many of the currently available solutions are lacking in usability and portability or they are using password managers that aren’t specifically designed for enterprise. In addition, many of these enterprise products are limited to software setups that businesses may not be equipped for and&#x2F;or may not want to purchase due to cost of maintenance, with equivalent, incompatible software systems already in place.<p>We would love to hear your feedback on our current product and what you would look for in an enterprise offering.<p>www.silverlockapp.com",

      "title": "Launch HN: Deviceplane (YC W20) – Update and Manage Devices Running Linux",
      "text": "Hey Hacker News! We&#x27;re Josh, Sean, and Cyrus from Deviceplane (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deviceplane.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deviceplane.com&#x2F;</a>).<p>Deviceplane is an open source device management tool for embedded systems, IoT, and edge computing. More specifically, we manage any device running Linux. These can be found in many different categories of hardware such as single-board computers (Raspberry Pis, Jetson Nanos), IoT devices&#x2F;gateways, and servers running at the edge.<p>The use cases for Linux devices span many different verticals&#x2F;industries: robotics, consumer appliances, drones, autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and much more. Your first thought might be that a tool for managing robots and a tool for managing medical devices are quite different, but after talking to a variety of companies, we&#x27;ve found that the pain points across these industries are actually quite similar!<p>Deviceplane solves the biggest infrastructure problems for these use cases:<p><pre><code>  - Orchestrating and deployment of remote updates\n  - Network connectivity and SSH access\n  - Host and application monitoring\n  - Device organization: naming, labeling, searching, and filtering of devices\n  - Access and security controls\n</code></pre>\nDeviceplane is designed to support a variety of hardware, from small embedded devices to large x86 servers. Today’s tooling ecosystem suffers from being segmented by hardware size.<p>For smaller devices, the Yocto project is popular. While it&#x27;s good for building custom Linux installations, it has downsides for delivering applications. It&#x27;s hard to understand, can take hours to compile, and solves only a portion of the problems present in device management.<p>For larger devices, many companies seem to build and maintain their own internal tooling. We&#x27;ve seen everything from systems built around configuration management to scripts polling for new Debian packages in S3. These systems are usually brittle, fall short of a complete feature set, and drain precious engineering resources with their maintenance.<p>We think Deviceplane is a great replacement for all of these. Not only is it suitable for all of these hardware sizes, it also presents a way to standardize the tooling across them.<p>One of our goals with Deviceplane is to make device management more accessible to developers. To do this, we build on technologies and concepts popularized in cloud deployments:<p><pre><code>  - Applications are packaged as containers and defined in a format resembling Docker Compose\n  - Updates can be rolled out and tested gradually by using &quot;canary&quot; deployments\n  - An intuitive and scriptable CLI that will feel familiar to Docker and Kubernetes users\n</code></pre>\nDeviceplane integrates with your device by running a lightweight static binary via your system supervisor. We can be used with nearly any Linux distro, which means you can continue using Ubuntu, Raspbian, a Yocto build, or whatever else fits your needs.<p>Deviceplane is completely open source. The code for everything from the agent to the backend and UI can be found on GitHub (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;deviceplane&#x2F;deviceplane\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;deviceplane&#x2F;deviceplane</a>). We put a lot of effort into making our open source version as easy as possible to run. You can even run the backend of Deviceplane with a single Docker command:<p>docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 deviceplane&#x2F;deviceplane<p>For more information on hosting Deviceplane yourself, check out our docs (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deviceplane.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;self-hosted&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deviceplane.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;self-hosted&#x2F;</a>).<p>If you&#x27;d rather jump right into managing devices, we have a hosted version available at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.deviceplane.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.deviceplane.com&#x2F;</a>.<p>Lastly, we&#x27;d love to hear more about your experiences managing devices! What have your biggest pain points been, and what infrastructure do you wish existed to solve those? Either comment here, or shoot us an email anytime at founders@deviceplane.com.",

      "text": "Hi all! We&#x27;re Yaseer, Simon and Alex from Axiom. We&#x27;ve built a way for non-technical people to automate work in their browser (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;axiom.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;axiom.ai</a>).<p>Axiom lets you automate by recording actions in the UI, like an Excel macro or Emacs, only it’s for the whole web. It can plug in to your APIs, too, to reach places tools like Zapier can’t. Gartner et. al. call this ‘RPA’ (Robotic Process Automation), but we don’t use this acronym with customers.<p>I’ve been a long-time HN lurker and occasional commenter. I decided to do a Show HN 9 months ago with v1.0, and people seemed to find it interesting: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23089243\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23089243</a>. That post was pretty transformative for us. We got our first users outside our local network in London. We got shared on international sites that syndicate HN content. We suddenly had users in Japan, Korea, Denmark... eventually 111 countries in 9 months.<p>The HN audience were both usefully kind and critical. With our social automations, you pointed out many violate TOS, and “your team needs to do better” (ouch!). That didn&#x27;t feel good at the time. But later, we learned this is no way to build a business - battling platform providers like LinkedIn does not scale.<p>We learned our value prop has to also benefit the platform we&#x27;re automating. LinkedIn automations - though widespread - don&#x27;t do this. I think we’ve achieved this with our use cases in e-commerce, like helping Amazon sellers do repetitive data entry or report-generation on their store. When we spoke to Amazon about automating repetitive work for sellers, they offered to introduce us to more. Google’s algorithms eventually boosted us to 3rd on the Chrome store for ‘browser automation’, and Microsoft... added special code in Bing to block us. This would have made us sad except, 2000 users later, we have not yet found someone using Bing.<p>Axiom has also evolved significantly. The problems we’re trying to solve with the DOM, Ajax and messy web-apps are hard ones. Not deep-tech hard, but if you’ve ever written a Selenium or Puppeteer script and tried to write an algorithm to detect the end of page-load... it’s not simple. Since our Show HN, we’ve extended the library of algorithms for more weird stuff you see in web apps: iframes, infinite scrolls, drag-and-drop - there&#x27;s a lot more to do. Web UIs are complex; if Axiom doesn&#x27;t work on a website, please let us know, we improve our algorithms with every edge-case.<p>Until recently, most of our users were no-code enthusiasts (i.e. users of Zapier or Airtable).  They used Axiom in agencies to manage YouTube and Amazon accounts. The dominant use-case was “generate reports by logging into A, B, C and getting data”.  Since YC though, we’ve discovered a bunch of developer and startup use cases. A very lightweight automated testing tool is a new one - using Axiom is 10X faster than writing it in selenium&#x2F;puppeteer + we handle all the annoying logic you need. We&#x27;re investigating a Node library for this - please let us know if it would be useful. Secondly, startups whose business is ‘we provide an API to do X’ use Axiom to perform whatever the &#x27;X&#x27; is behind the API - e.g. booking on a travel website.<p>Although Axiom is primarily a Chrome extension, our cloud product needs neither Chrome, nor an extension! It has a virtual browser, with a full GUI, like you see in browser testing services. You can run it 24&#x2F;7, or trigger it from Zapier or your API. If you build a bot on the desktop version, we&#x27;ll guide you through setting it up in the cloud. If you don&#x27;t use chrome, and would like cloud access, register here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;axiom.ai&#x2F;bot-building-service\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;axiom.ai&#x2F;bot-building-service</a>. Being Chrome-only makes us worryingly dependent on Google - we definitely will support other browsers after YC. Right now though, our small team needs to prioritise fast iteration.<p>We built Axiom on a pretty popular framework, Puppeteer, which requires desktop binaries to run. This means you need an Electron app, too. Trust me, It hurts us more than it hurts you, supporting Electron on Windows, Mac &amp; Linux. This does make us one of the only cross-platform RPA tools - Mac and Linux users have told us they appreciate this.<p>Our cloud product doesn’t need any of this- but it does mean we process your data. With our desktop app, your data is processed 100% locally. We store the code which defines your script, but not the data it operates on.<p>Finally, the community on HN is more influential than you may realize -  taking interest in our HN post changed the trajectory of our company entirely. Also, we discovered responding to hard questions from smart people on HN is pretty good prep for talking to investors, or a YC interview. HN&#x27;s interest was fundamental for us getting in. We&#x27;d like to thank the community here. In fact, my first ever submission 4 years ago asked (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15098066\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15098066</a>),  &#x27;Ask HN: what online communities offer a high level of discussion like HN?&#x27; There&#x27;s very few. It&#x27;s a unique corner of the internet.<p>If you run into any issues with Axiom, please reach out to support - we&#x27;re very proactive at getting you running. Otherwise, please post any feedback, ideas, questions or relevant experience - we&#x27;d love to hear it again!<p>Note:  M1 Mac users, we have a workaround on our support page for any issues. A hotfix for M1 is imminent.",

Using Let&#x27;s Encrypt, good automatic cert usage should be trivial. VLANs and VPN are something everyone with IOT should be thinking about. Etc. None of this is radical new technology, just quality implementations and a good GUI bringing together existing stuff, and with zero remote service reqs beyond the optional signing authority (and it should support just running your own root, let the appliance have a USB to make use of HSMs like a Yubikey too).

          "text": "As far as how tied to Disney they are: the project lead and initial sole developer (others chip in quite a bit now) is an employee of Disney. My impression is that he&#x27;s open to changing things but not if those changes interfere or complicate their deployment at Disney. So I&#x27;d say definitely Disney-prioritized rather than a straight up community project. Affiliated projects like AutoPkg are community driven and somewhat tool agnostic.<p>I think what you should use depends on your available time, inclination and mindset. I meant for this to be short but it ended up being ridiculously long. Sorry about that. Hopefully it helps save you and anyone else the time required to get a broad understanding of this space. tl;dr at the bottom.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t bother with Server App. It&#x27;s complete crap. Maybe useful for &gt;10 macs but I&#x27;m honestly not sure if that&#x27;s even true given all the ways it can totally shit the bed on you. Not well maintained. Probably best to think of it more as a reference implementation for 3rd parties developing an MDM solution.<p>If you have time for the learning curve, want to apply the configuration as code&#x2F;automated testing mindset and want&#x2F;need to save money go with the open source tools. Don&#x27;t expect to be able to commit the commercial versions to source control. \nMunki+Reposado+Margarita+AutoPkg for sure:<p>Munki: Nothing touches it terms of the core&#x2F;engine&#x27;s package installation abilities. Repo is configured by the admin&#x2F;tools like autopkg so it&#x27;s just a static repo that can be hosted by any web server. Customizable self-service app that&#x27;s very similar to the app store app.<p>Reposado: Let&#x27;s you do pipeline&#x2F;canary testing&#x2F;one-some-many deployments of your official Apple updates since they can rarely mess things up on their own but more frequently break some software.<p>Margarita: Web UI for managing Reposado, only needed if you want&#x2F;need that or just don&#x27;t want to deal with figuring out how to manage&#x2F;automate it.<p>AutoPkg: This is so amazing you&#x27;ll want this even if you use something like Casper but it was designed with Munki in mind. Using recipes it downloads updates for software from the vendor&#x27;s websites&#x2F;repositories, repackages as necessary and can be configured to automatically add those as updates for your existing packages. So you can get security updates and force their installation long before your average laptop user bothers to update. You can do pipeline&#x2F;canary testing&#x2F;one-some-many deployments using your preferred CICD tool (Jenkins seems to be popular for this). Recipes are maintained in a community repo so even if a vendor changes their site and breaks things someone has probably noticed before you and provided a fix.<p>Key differentiators for these: Open Source, configuration management as code, automation, testing, CICD, etc.<p>Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt or GitHub&#x27;s Boxen (Uses Puppet but has an opinionated layer on top): If you want more configuration management and distributing it via packages through Munki isn&#x27;t your cup of tea use one of these in addition to Munki.\nKey differentiators: Open Source, configuration management as code, automation, testing, CICD, etc.<p>If you want easy as pie and very SMB oriented take a look at JAMF&#x27;s Bushel. It&#x27;s clean looking and subscription based and probably the least amount of effort overall. It&#x27;s cloud-only I believe, so if on-prem is a requirement look at the next one. Not sure if you can do custom packages or much in the way of config but you can definitely distribute Apple App store applications.\nKey differentiators: modern, easy to use and quick to get started with. Auto-magic enrollment of devices you buy (as long as they are through the same account). Distributed App Store apps.<p>If you want more control and a decent GUI (particularly if you have a decent number of Macs) take a look at JAMF&#x27;s Casper. Warning: The trial is limited to 14 days but you can purchase a 45 or 60 day trial+2 or 3 days of training for a mere ~$4K or $6K. Training I think is provided by a VAR&#x2F;Partner. No you can&#x27;t use it after that unless you buy it. Expect a hard and high touch sales experience since this is more or less enterprise software. There&#x27;s a cloud version and on-prem version. On-prem will require some upkeep (MySQL instance to manage, java app that runs on tomcat, etc.). You should use AutoPkg with Casper too even if it&#x27;s a bit annoying to get setup.\nKey differentiators: Big community with a lot of answers and advice that are often universal enough to be useful no matter what you&#x27;re using. Very enterprise-y so good if you need that (contract, support, feel good sales pitch to management). Easy to use for junior admins or support people. Easy self-service that customizable per-person&#x2F;group. Auto-magic enrollment of devices you buy (as long as they are through the same account).<p>Note: The JAMF sales people might bring in a rep from Apple&#x27;s Enterprise Support team during the sales process to talk about the benefits of Casper (they use it at Apple) as well as (surprise) pitch their enterprise support services and a package called enterprise connect. Enterprise connect is essentially a workaround for bad UX&#x2F;bugs in Apple&#x27;s directory services support that they want you to pay for. When the Apple rep told us that you&#x27;d be silly to use open source tools we asked about Google and Facebook and he replied, &quot;Yeah... well they probably think they&#x27;re pretty smart! Haha.&quot; Backpedaling ensued and he said, &quot;Well of course they&#x27;re smart, they just have different problems.&quot; When pressed about the problems Casper couldn&#x27;t resolve for them he said &quot;scale&quot; after conferring with another person at Apple.<p>There are others but either I don&#x27;t know enough about them to offer any insight or they aren&#x27;t worth mentioning for various reasons.<p>tl;dr:<p>Munki&#x2F;Reposado&#x2F;AutoPkg: If you can afford the learning curve and need&#x2F;want the DevOps tools&#x2F;automation&#x2F;philosophy.<p>Bushel: If you want easy, no hassle and automatic device enrollment, SMB.<p>Casper: If you want a GUI, enterprise features and automatic device enrollment, easy self-service, have a decent number of Macs.",

To that end, Apple has made some updates to improve that situation.<p>Both the enterprise and education programs now have support for Mobile Device Management hands-free configuration. This ‘zero touch’ setup has been a long-requested feature for many pros, as it eliminates the need to cable up every deployed device and install a profile via Apple’s Configurator utility.&quot;</i>",

          "text": "Funny, we just had this just hit the front page against environment variables for secrets. <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8826024\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8826024</a><p>It&#x27;s not clear from the doc you linked that you would support AWS STS, which is probably the right way to approach minimal privilege and to reduce the time window that an attacker would have the privileges of the entity compromised. Wish I had a way to calculate that out from the tools I had which helps drastically during an investigation to sift through network logs.<p>What you seem to have built so far is what could be used to build a more modern shared secret access stack rather than being a full solution itself. Most companies that want to pay for something want to have something that will rotate out keys &amp; passwords or enforce secrets policies like separation of keys across different nodes in your high availability solution for them (eg. the DB, root, and LDAP cached passwords should not be stored on the same data node even in encrypted form). Otherwise, a lot of companies have built equivalent solutions like Conjur already (to varying degrees of success depending upon how dysfunctional their IT already is). A lot of the custom solutions I&#x27;m familiar with in Defense &#x2F; IC space are starting to use Apache Accumulo to enforce a great deal of sharing and storing of secrets. The architecture of that makes it possible to have tables split both column-wise and row-wise across multiple nodes based upon business rules like HIPAA, FISMA, PCI-DSS, etc. Tack on Zookeeper with some SASL and you&#x27;ll spend the next year or two just arranging the meetings to figure out the security rules.<p>For an analogy, it seems like you&#x27;ve built a lot of the workings of Postgres missing something important like procedural queries and triggers, but organizations really want an ORM (they just don&#x27;t even realize it because the whole industry is built around bikeshedding topics in security). Build something respecting the vernacular and culture of engineers, IT opsec &#x2F; compliance, and (more importantly) the managers of both orgs and you should have a winner. Ok, after you find the right sales guys to get the attention of some F500s that are in terrible industries wracked by compliance BS 24&#x2F;7.<p>All in all, good idea and it looks promising, I&#x27;ll keep your product in mind if I can get a management tool like this even suggested. We&#x27;re doing some extremely bad practices at present in order to avoid violating OTHER no-nos keeping stuff out of the public cloud, and our IAM across dozens and dozens of AWS accounts is completely bonkers and the bungling of the credentials as the after-effect is probably causing worse security problems than if we just gave them all the same keypairs. It&#x27;d be really interesting to see this work seamlessly across both AWS-like environments and a vSphere&#x2F;vCAC&#x2F;vCD type of environment using affinity &#x2F; anti-affinity rules to make initial guesses about your security configuration. Pretty sure everything in an autoscaling group should be by default in the same group or &quot;layer&quot; (in your terminology), for example, and you could start with the same for vSphere compute clusters, unless host anti-affinity rules for a VM are present, which usually means that the VM is not allowed to cross a physical boundary and is a hint at a business level policy rather than a technical one (nobody does cross-geographic clusters besides Google last I saw, and you probably aren&#x27;t going to be able to sell this to them....).<p>One thing that would tremendously help in your documentation would be to provide security scenarios for different user stories and potential users. Admins across multiple tenant business units have different use cases than developers that are working in maybe one or two organizations &#x2F; groups, for example. I found myself expecting a &quot;I am a... X, Y, Z&quot; set of tabs and wanted to see each of their use case scenarios for one or two sample companies with different needs. Besides the &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be your guinea pig&quot; mentality, this is what companies are really looking for half the time they ask for a reference customer.",
